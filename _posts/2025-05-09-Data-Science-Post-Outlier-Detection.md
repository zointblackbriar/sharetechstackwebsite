# Introduction to Outlier Detection

Outlier detection refers to a process of finding items that are unusual. For tabular data, this usually means identifying unusual rows in a table; for image data, unusual images; 
for text data, unusual documents, and similarity for other data types. Outlier detection operates on the assumption that the majority of items within a dataset can be considered normal, while those that differ significantly from the majority may be considered unusual, or outliers.
